This Python script takes a Web Adaptor 11.x log file, parses the content, and writes it to a csv file for ease of analysis.

To use the script, download the .py file, edit the logFileName variable to point to your Web Adaptor log file, and execute it with your favorite Python interpreter.  The tool can be run with the Python included with ArcGIS Server.
